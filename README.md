## Installing the Deployment Utility <a name="installing"></a>
First you need to clone the repository to your local computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Improbable-AI/walk-these-ways
```
The second step is to [connect your development machine to the robot.](#connecting) 

You should ping the robot to verify the connection: `ping 192.168.123.15` should return `x packets transmitted, x received, 0% packet loss`.

Once you have confirmed the robot is connected, run the following command on your computer to transfer files to the robot. The first time you run it, the script will download and transfer the zipped docker image for development on the robot (`deployment_image.tar`). This file is quite large (3.5GB), but it only needs to be downloaded and transferred once.

```
cd go1_gym_deploy/scripts && ./send_to_unitree.sh
```

Next, you will log onto the robot's onboard computer and install the docker environment. To enter the onboard computer, the command is:

```
ssh unitree@192.168.123.15
```
The password is `123`.

Now, run the following commands on the robot's onboard computer:

```
chmod +x installer/install_deployment_code.sh
cd ~/go1_gym/go1_gym_deploy/scripts
sudo ../installer/install_deployment_code.sh
```

The installer will automatically unzip and install the docker image containing the deployment environment. 
## Running the Controller  <a name="runcontroller"></a>

Place the robot into damping mode. The control sequence is: [L2+A], [L2+B], [L1+L2+START]. After this, the robot should sit on the ground and the joints should move freely. 

Now, ssh to `unitree@192.168.123.15` and run the following two commands to start the controller. <b>This will operate the robot in low-level control mode. Make sure your Go1 is hung up.</b>

First:
```
cd ~/go1_gym/go1_gym_deploy/autostart
./start_unitree_sdk.sh
```

Second:
```
cd ~/go1_gym/go1_gym_deploy/docker
sudo make autostart
```

The robot will wait for you to press [R2], then calibrate, then wait for a second press of [R2] before running the control loop.

## The RC Mapping  <a name="rcconfig"></a>
![RC Mapping](https://github.com/Improbable-AI/walk-these-ways/blob/master/media/rc_map.png?raw=true)
The RC mapping is depicted above.

## Addendums <a name="addendums"></a>
### How to connect to the robot <a name="connecting"></a>
#### Using WiFi

1. Connect to the Go1's WiFi `cachorro_robo`. The password is `0000000`
2. Make sure that ip forwarding is enabled. ([How to enable ip forwarding](#ipforwarding))
3. You should ping the robot to verify the connection: `ping 192.168.123.15` should return `x packets transmitted, x received, 0% packet loss`.

#### Using an Ethernet Cable

1. Connect the ethernet cable.
2. Make sure that the subnet of your ethernet adapter is 192.168.123.42/24. ([How to change subnet](#subnet))
3. You should ping the robot to verify the connection: `ping 192.168.123.15` should return `x packets transmitted, x received, 0% packet loss`.


### How to change subnet <a name="subnet"></a>
`ifconfig` to list all interfaces (they look like `enp1s0` for ethernet and `wlp2s0` for wifi)
```
sudo ifconfig <interface> down
sudo ifconfig <interface> 192.168.123.42/24
sudo ifconfig <interface> up
```

### How to enable ip forwarding <a name="ipforwarding"></a>
1. SSH to Pi with password 123
```bash
ssh pi@192.168.12.1
```

2. Execute the following code on the robot's Raspberry Piï¼š
```bash
sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
```

3. Remove the comment in front of `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`

4. Reload sysctl
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

5. Setup iptables for wireless config

* Flush iptables
```bash
sudo iptables -F
```

* Flush NAT table
```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -F
```
* Setup NAT table routing
```bash
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan1 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan1 -o eth0 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -o wlan1 -j ACCEPT
```
